1) Read a dataset for testing networks
    - Study time dimensions and what not
    - Default to Poisson Encoding at first 
    - Verifiy dims of resulting dataset
    - Divide into train validation and test (check if labels are necessary)

2) Try to assemble a network from a grammar
    - Default to Input as it is 
    - Simple geno to feno conversion 
    - Check if you can actually run the network with random weights 
    - Try to initialize a random population

3) Try to run a trainining / validation testing and collect metrics 

4) Try to pump the engine (seems simple right?)
